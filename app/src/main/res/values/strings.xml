        The Treaty of Trianon was the peace agreement of 1920 to formally end World War I between
        most of the Allies of World War I and the Kingdom of Hungary, the latter being one of the
        successor states to Austria-Hungary.\n\n

        The treaty regulated the status of an independent Hungarian state and defined its borders.
        It left Hungary as a landlocked state covering 93,073 square kilometres (35,936 sq mi), only
        28% of the 325,411 square kilometres (125,642 sq mi) that had constituted the pre-war
        Kingdom of Hungary (the Hungarian half of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy).\n\n

        Its population was
        7.6 million, only 36% of the pre-war kingdom\'s population of 20.9 million. The areas that
        were allocated to neighbouring countries in total (and each of them separately) possessed a
        majority of non-Hungarian population, but 31% of Hungarians (3.3 million) were left outside
        of post-Trianon Hungary. Five of the pre-war kingdom\'s ten largest cities were
        drawn into other countries. The treaty limited Hungary\'s army to 35,000 officers and men,
        while the Austro-Hungarian Navy ceased to exist.
